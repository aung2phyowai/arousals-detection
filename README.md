# Automatic detection of EEG arousals in EDF files

Algorithm for the automatic detection of EEG arousals in EDF files. Most of it is based on the work: 

I. Fernández-Varela, D. Alvarez-Estevez, E. Hernández-Pereira, V. Moret-Bonillo, _A simple and robust method for the automatic scoring of EEG arousals in polysomnographic recordings._ Computers in Biology and Medicine, vol. 87, pp. 77-86, 2017 

Some updates have been realized since its publication, towards a method that generalizes better. This way you can use with your own EDF files.
